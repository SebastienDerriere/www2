    <TD>The purpose of this session is to bring the participants up
	to speed on the latest compression techniques that are being used or
	proposed for use in various astronomical applications. Downlink from
	spacecraft, transmission between ground-based servers and users, and
	archiving will all be included.</TD>

    <TD>The goal is to have a number of short presentations, with or
	without vugraphs, by any participants who have worked in this area. 
	The organizer will give a presentation on JPEG 2000, and encourages 
	other participants to describe their experience with or plans for 
	other compression algorithms. A general audience discussion will 
	follow.</TD>

    <TD><P>This BoF session is connected to the poster paper by Dubernet et al. 
	"Atomic and Molecular Physics Databases in the Virtual Observatories".
Atomic and molecular databases are an example of distributed resources 
which are used in numerous astrophysical applications, in particular 
in the interpretation of spectra provided by space/ground based current 
and future instruments (HSO, ALMA, etc..). However, specific questions 
raised by the access to these databases in the VO paradigm have not yet 
been addressed. It is important to make atomic and molecular data widely 
available in interrelating databases with VO projects ; this would allow 
in particular uniqueness of data used in astrophysical models and 
automatic access to these data from web applications developed for 
spectrum analysis or modelling.

<P>The aim of this BoF session is to gather people involved in atomic and 
molecular databases development or working with atomic and molecular 
data and concerned with interoperability matters; this is in order to:
<UL>
   <LI>try to compile efforts which are already started in this domain;</LI>
   <LI>evaluate the needs, feasibility and requirements of the targeted 
	interrelation of atomic and molecular data bases with VO projects;</LI>
   <LI>to establish collaborations and set up a group of persons which could 
	act as a representative with VO projects</LI>
</UL>
	<P>People who intend to attend the session will be able to find some 
	useful information in English after October 1 at URL: 
	<A HREF="http://wwwusr.obspm.fr/~vo-phys/PAGE-VO/main.html">

    <TD><P>The organizers will give a short presentation addressing what has 
	been initiated in the french community and about the technical 
	issues which have been tackled in the particular case of the 
	collisional ro-vibrational molecular database 
	(http://basecol.obs-besancon.fr) ; as a typical VO case, the 
	question of the representation of molecular data in the VOTables 
	framework will be discussed.

	<P>Participants are strongly encouraged to give short presentations 
	about their own work related to atomic and molecular data bases 
	interoperability or data dissemination ; a contact with the organizers 
	of the session beforehand would improve the interest and ease the 
	organization of the session.

	<P>A general discussion will follow which would hopefully result in the 
	set up of a coordination structure whose aim has been described above.
