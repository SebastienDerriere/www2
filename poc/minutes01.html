<H1>Summary</H1>
<P>
The following is a summary of the discussion of items listed in the 
<A HREF="agenda01.html">meeting agenda</A>. 
</P>

<H3>1. Report of ADASS XI LOC</H3>
<P>
The conference was running very smoothly, and the POC gratefully 
acknowledged the outstanding efforts of the LOC in hosting ADASS XI.  
The unofficial total registrations reached about 240 prior to the 
terrorist attacks of 11 Sept., which was almost 20% higher than the 
last time ADASS was held in Victoria (1993).  Subsequent cancellations 
brought the total registrants down to about 220, although that total 
includes 10 no-shows.  Several of the cancellations were the result of 
institutional restrictions on travel imposed after Sept. 11.  
Considering the tremendous uncertainty in the few weeks prior to the  
conference, the impact on ADASS XI appears to have been fairly small. </P>

<P>
The new walk-up DHCP and wireless network connections (for personal 
laptops) appeared to be very popular, and the handling of electronic 
presentations appears to have set a new standard of excellence.  The 
banquet was a tremendous success, and apparently was self-funding. 
While the oral program did suffer from the withdrawal of one invited 
and five contributed presentations, the overall program remained 
strong.  The last session was cancelled, and additional time was 
allowed between some oral sessions for poster viewing. </P>

<H3>2. Budget</H3>
<H4>LOC Budget</H4>
<P>
This conference was budgeted to break even if the attendance exceeded 
about 200, although there were some late, unanticipated expenses that have 
yet to be factored in. Even with several cancellations, early indications 
suggest that expenses will match revenues to within a few thousand 
dollars.  Dick mentioned that a small over-run could be covered by the 
ADASS carry-over funds. Approximately 70 people attended the Python 
tutorial, meaning that even with substantial support to the speaker and 
additional costs for the auditorium space, it was a net contributor 
to the budget. </P>

<P>
A discussion ensued about what position to take with regard to people 
who chose or were compelled to cancel their ADASS registration.  The 
strong concensus was to provide refunds in strict accordance with the 
advertised policy, i.e., full refunds minus a CAD$40 fee for cancellations 
received by 21 Sept., and no refunds for cancellations received afterward. 
It is likely that, had the terrorist attacks occured as little as one 
week after 11 Sept., ADASS XI would have been cancelled.  While 
no one would like to think that another such calamity will ever occur, 
it is possible to imagine less dramatic circumstances that could put a 
given conference in doubt.  A lesson learned for future ADASS conferences 
is that <B>it is critical to review the cancellation policy to ensure a 
sufficient margin of financial security against unforseen events.</B> </P>

<P>
This year a number of POC members noted that the quantity and quality of 
financial aid applicants was lower this year than in years past.  [A 
database of financial aid recipients is being build by Irene Barg and 
Betty Stobie.]  This may be a result of two factors: for budgetary reasons 
only USD$5000 was allocated to direct financial aid (beyond support for 
invited speakers), and the stated policy of 
no support for transportation.  It was agreed that more funds should be 
allocated next year if possible, and that the policy should be re-worded 
such that travel funds are permitted in exceptional circumstances.  The 
idea is that full funding might be offered for one or two exceptionally 
well qualified applicants, even if fewer people can be supported overall, 
and that this would not place too heavy a burden on the LOCs to make 
travel arrangements. 
</P>

<H4>Carry-Over Account</H4>
<P>
The balance in the carry-over fund is roughly $20,000, not including an 
expected return of nearly $13,000 once the books are closed on ADASS X, 
and a promised contribution from the NSF of $5000.  Approximately 
$14,000 is obligated to pay for the proceedings of ADASS XI.  The activity 
for the past ~year is: </P>

<P>
Roughly $24,000 of un-obligated funds will be left in the carry-over 
account, unless we need to make up a shortfall in the ADASS XI budget. 
Provided that future institutional and agency contributions are similar 
to this year, and future conference budgets are approximately balanced, 
the carry-over account should remain healthy for the forseeable future.

<H3>3. Publication of the Proceedings</H3>
<H4>Report from ADASS X Proceedings Editors</H4>
<P>
The editor team for ADASS X (Harnden, Primini & Payne) reports that the 
proceedings volumes are being shipped to all ADASS X participants. Some 
concern has been expressed over the past few months about the year-long 
publication cycle that typifies the ADASS proceedings.  Rick and his 
editor team have written a <A HREF="EditorialPolicy.html">set of 
recommendations</A> that they believe will streamline the editing process. 
Beyond that, there was general agreement that the deadline for receiving 
manuscripts for the proceedings should be no later than 3 weeks following 
the conference. 
</P>

<H4>Report from ADASS XI Proceedings Editors</H4>
<P>
The editor team for ADASS XI (Bohlender, Durand & Handley) report that 
the <A HREF="http://cadcwww.hia.nrc.ca/adass_2001/manuscripts.html">
author resources</A> for manuscript preparation are ready and available 
from the ADASS XI Website. </P>
<P>
[<B>An issue not covered:</B> should someone write up a 1-2 page summary 
for the PASP "Conference Highlights" section?  This is potentially good 
advertising for ADASS in the community. Are there volunteers?] </P> 

<H4>Selection of 2002 Proceedings Editor Team</H4>
<P>
The editor team for ADASS `02 should be selected in the next few months 
so that they may prepare instructions, files, and procedures for the 
for the next meetings' submissions, and so that the experience of the 
current editor team can be transferred to them smoothly. 
It would be prudent to name at least 3 editors, owing to the quantity of 
work to be performed; ideally at least one of them would be an experienced 
ASP proceedings editor, and one or two of them should be solicted from next 
year's LOC.

<H4>Review of ADASS Paper Presentation Policy</H4>
<P>
A review of the <A HREF="http://www.adass.org/PaperPolicy.html">
ADASS paper presentation policy</A> and its implementation for ADASS X 
was prepared by Rick Harnden. While the current restriction of one oral or 
poster paper per presenting author has a virtue of simplicity, it has some 
disadvantages, including the cost of enforcing the rules for 10-12 authors 
each year who submit more than one abstract anyway, and the perception 
that the rule places "career" software developers at major institutions 
at a disadvantage. The following suggestion was offered as a compromise: 

<UL>
    <LI>Allow authors to present more than one contribution, <I>but 
	retain the limitation of one oral contribution</I>
    <LI>Charge a fee for each contribution after the first (not counting 
	demos)
    <LI>Retain the remainder of the policy as-is
</UL>
<P>
One implication of the above proposal is that the abstract submission 
process will have to be closely tied to the registration so that the 
proper fees can be assessed.  [<B>An issue not addressed:</B> what policy 
should apply to financial aid recipients?] </P>

<H3>4. Future ADASS Venues</H3>
<H4>Baltimore 2002</H4>
<P>
The next ADASS conference will be hosted by STScI from 13 - 16 Oct. 2002 at the 
<A HREF="http://www.marriotthotels.com/dpp/PropertyPage.asp?MarshaCode=BWIWF&checked=True&Marriott_BD={AF74F65D-ABC3-4B6D-873D-0D9E6AF80D58}">Marriott Waterfront Hotel</A>.  See the website at <A HREF="http://adass2002.stsci.edu/">

The ADASS XII LOC at the moment consists of the following individuals: 
<UL>
    <LI>Perry Greenfield (Chair)
    <LI>David Adler
    <LI>Paul Barret
    <LI>Howard Bushouse
    <LI>Brian McLean
    <LI>Lauretta Nagel
</UL>
<P>
The budget is being finalized.  The LOC would like to use part of the 
registration fee to offset some of the cost to participants of the room 
rate, which would be at least $206/night otherwise. The point is to 
bring the room cost down to approximately what nearby hotels charge (in 
order to increase the chance that the commitment of 600 room-nights will 
be met), and to apportion the actual cost of the facilities to local 
participants. </P>
<P>
A very brief discussion of the program for ADASS XII yielded  
a few suggestions for key topics:</P>
<UL>
    <LI>Calibration
    <LI>Control Systems
    <LI>Large Telescopes
</UL>
It was suggested that those POC members most closely connected to the 
(various) VO projects offer suggestions for topics/speakers in this area 
as it becomes clearer what progress is being made in the next year.  It 
was generally agreed that a colleague from Japan be identified as a 
candidate for an invited speaker, in an effort to be more inclusive, 
internationally speaking, and to reverse a perceived trend of declining 
participation from Japan. </P>

<H4>Strasbourg, France in 2003</H4>
<P>
In 2003 ADASS will be hosted by CDS in or near Strasbourg, France from 
13-16 Oct. 2003.  The venue may be the Strasbourg Convention Center, but 
this is not yet firm, as it depends on whether the European Parliment 
convenes during that time.  Alternative sites are being explored.  

<H4>2004 and Beyond</H4>
<P>
IPAC/Caltech will host ADASS in 2004; Tom Handley is the contact person. 
NOAO/Tucson is a possibility for 2005.

<H3>5. POC Membership</H3>
<P>
Rick Harnden and Doug Tody will step down from the POC following this meeting. 
These individuals have been a guiding force behind ADASS since its inception, 
and the POC expressed their deep appreciation for their service and 
dedication. Doug and Rick have agreed to remain on the POC e-mail list as 
"information only" members. </P>
<P>
Suggestions were offered to add a POC member to represent SAO (to replace 
Rick), and to consider a POC member from Japan. Some nominees: 
</P>
<UL>
    <LI>Koh-Ichiro Morita (ALMA/Japan)
    <LI>Michele Peron (ESO)
    <LI>Dr. Peter Quinn (ESO)
    <LI><A HREF="http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~arots/">Dr. Arnold Rots</A> (CfA)

<H3>6. The adass.org Web site</H3>
<P>
The <A HREF="http://www.adass.org/">adass.org</A> Web site has developed 
steadily, if slowly, over the last year. The pages that contain the ADASS 
"corporate" memory, currently hosted at STScI, will be migrated to 
adass.org in the near future.  These pages include a collection of notes 
to support LOC planning, among other things.  "Career services" resources 
will be developed by Ray Plante and Gareth Hunt over the next few months. 
The concept is still under development, but job postings, links to sites 
related to computer/IT jobs, and a "subscription" service are likely to be 
offered. </P>
