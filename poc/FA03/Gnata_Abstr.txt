ABSTRACT :
----------
End-to-end simulation of the JWST/NIRSpec instrument

The near-infrared multi-object spectrograph NIRSpec is one of the three
science instruments onboard the future James Webb Space Telescope. NIRSpec
will cover the 0.6 to 5.0 µm wavelength range and will be able to obtain
simultaneous spectra of more than 100 objects in a 9 square arcminute
field of
view, thanks to an array of micro-shutters. It has been realised that an
accurate modelling of the instrument was needed: to obtain realistic
estimates
of its expected performances and to check that the science goals could be
achieved; to define and validate the operation and calibration
scenarios; and,
on the long run, to develop and test the data reduction software. In this
context and as part of the EADS NIRSpec study funded by ESA, we have
developed
an end-to-end Fourier-optics model of the instrument, which takes into
account
both geometrical aberrations and diffraction. In this presentation, I will
first describe the model, its objectives and its implementation. I will
then
show some results and how they are used to estimate the instrument
performances. I will conclude by stressing that this kind of modelling
is now
becoming a standard task in the studies of some major astronomical
instruments.
