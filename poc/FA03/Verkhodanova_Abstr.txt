Presentation Title:
Description of radio spectra and multi frequency data as one object

Presentation Abstract:

We discuss a problem of description of multi frequency data.
It appears in tasks of radio spectrum fitting for separate sources
and of incorporation of single source information into the system
of catalogues processed like in the CATS database (http://cats.sao.ru).
We developed FITS-like format allowing one to describe analytical
spectrum curves unified with multi frequency data of flux density
measurements.
This approach has been used in description of spectra of
decametric radio source and identified objects with multi frequency
catalogues in the CATS database. Resulting data have been incorporated
into the CATS and opened for astronomical community.
The developed format is occurred very useful in spectrum fitting procedures
and component separation of radio continuum spectral data.
Problems of identification and data storage of new class of objects in the
CATS are discussed. Examples of FITS-like formats are given.
