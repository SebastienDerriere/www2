Sirs:
I wish to recommend Dr. Ninan Sajeeth Philip for support in
traveling to ADASS 2003. I have known Sajeeth since Oct1998, and
hosted a visit of his during the period Jun02-09,2001 at
Arizona State University. During this most productive stay we
collaborated on a project to develop methods of automatically
classifying galaxy morphological classes. I found Sajeeth's expertise
in the area of artificial neural networks to be of critical help.
As a result of this work, we produced a paper discussing this work
(Odewahn etal 2002, ApJ,568,239) with Sajeeth as a co-author.

I should also like to mention that Sajeeth delivered an excellent
seminar on the subject of the DBNN pattern recognition software
he has developed in his research . This talk was attended
by many members of our Physics and Astronomy department and
was extremely well received. I look forward to many fruitful
collaborations with Mr. Ninan in the near future. I assure you
that his participation in ADASS 2003 will be highly beneficial.

Sincerely,
Stephen C. Odewahn
