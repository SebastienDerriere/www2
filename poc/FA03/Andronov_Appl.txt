Dear Prof. Marc Wenger,
I would like to attend the ADASS conference and to present a review paper

1. I.L.Andronov. "Wavelet and Scalegram Analysis of (Irregularly Spaced)
Astronomical Signals"

and (preliminary)

2. I.L.Andronov, L.L.Chinarova, J.Cuypers, J.L.Halbwachs, S.Piquard.
"Automatic Photometric Classification of the Hipparcos-Tycho Suspected
Variable Stars"

I would like to ask for a complete financial support of my trip covering the
travel (~550Euro), visa (50 Euro), accomodation expenses and the
registration fee. Unfortunately, our University has no possibility to
support trips abroad.

Looking forward for Your understanding,
remembering my short-term stay in Strasbourg in 1999,

With best wishes and thanks,

Ivan L.Andronov,
Professor of the Department of Astronomy,
Faculty of Physics, Odessa National University

P.S. On August 18-22, we organize a conference "Interacting Binary
Stars-2003" with a special section on mathematical methods for modeling
astronomical signals ( http://oap16.pochtamt.ru ). Welcome!
