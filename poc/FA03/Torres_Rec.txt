Dear Sirs,

It is a pleasure to write on behalf of Juan Pablo Torres Papaqui
request for financial support at ADASS 2003.

I've know Juan Pablo for the past 18 month
since he started his PhD at the Instituto Nacional de Astrofisica, Optica
y Electronica in Mexico.

His PhD thesis work includes a survey of the stellar population in the
central regions of active galaxies, in particular Radiogalaxies and
Seyfert types 1 and 2. He has had several observing runs at the
2.2 m telescope of the Cananea Observatory (Mexico) and the 3.5m NTT of
the European Southern Observatory (Chile), and has up to now collected
about 200 2-D high S/N spectra of almost 150 active galaxies.
He is currently analysing the data in combination with new population
synthesis
models from Sandro Bressan (Padova) that includes the Padova stellar
evolutionary tracks and high resolution (R \= 10,000) model stellar
atmospheres
with a wide range of metallicities.
The new models allow a detailed comparison of central properties
and gradients between models and observations.
Given the amount of data and the details of the new models,
the complexity of this analysis is enormous.

I am very impressed with Juan Pablo's quick
appreciation of what were the critical aspects of a
research project. His approach to a problem is always thoughtful.
I would like to underline that Juan Pablo is one of the best graduate
student in Mexico and compares very well with Cambridge PhD students.
Furthermore, he is one of those few students that need
very little prompting. After a suggestion is made the next thing you
know is that all is done and properly sorted.
He is efficient and careful at the telescope, and quick to grasp the
complexities of new instrumentation. He is also aware of the limitations
and uncertainties in the finished product (reduced data).
Such critical appreciation is not usually that developed in a graduate
student.
At the personal level, he is friendly and open. He also has a good
knowledge of English.

Yours sincerely,

Roberto Terlevich

Dear Organizers,

I am extremely pleased to write in support of Thamar Solorio

I have known Thamar since she started her PhD at the
Instituto Nacional de Astrofisica, Optica y Electronica in Mexico.
So my comments are based on the last 10 months.

I rate her extremely highly among the best young graduates in the area and
not
afraid to challenge convention wisdom with some original thinking.
She is gifted, motivated and with good knowledge of English.
It is my firm opinion that Thamar Solorio will
develop into an outstanding reseracher capable of the best original
research.

Yours Sincerely,

Dr. Roberto Terlevich
