Dear Sirs,

The following is to support the Financial Aid application of Juan Carlos
Gomez Carranza to attend the Astronomical Data Analysis
Software & Systems XIII Meeting.

Juan Carlos is one of the brightest PhD students we have received at the
Instituto Nacional de Astrofisica, Optica y Electronica (INAOE).

Juan Carlos is a very talented and enthusiastic student. The topic of this
meeting is closely related to the research he is doing for his PhD,
and he will profit of his participation. He is starting the second year of
his PhD under the advise of Olac Fuentes and partially collaborating with
Lia Athanassoula, in France. They are applying a new method developed by
Juan Carlos to study the interaction of galaxies.

This meeting will be an incredible and fruitful experience for
Juan Carlos, because it is a very good opportunity to improve and
complement his research in Astronomy, to exchange ideas, and to start new
collaborations.

Regards

Raul Mujica Garcia
Investigador Titular
Astronomy Department
INAOE
