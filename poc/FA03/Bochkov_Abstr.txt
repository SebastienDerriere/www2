Presentation Title: Automation of Spectrophotometric Data Processing

Presentation Abstract:
A prototype of 32-bit database application for Windows was developed for the 
task to obtain absolute energy spectral distributions of observed object.
Automation process of spectral data absolute energy calibration based on GUI 
interface capabilities, special scripting language development and using 
special structure databases of spectra.  Spectral data analysing includes 
continuum normalisation, spectral bands centre definition, stellar magnitudes 
calculation, and photometric light curve demonstration.  

A set of C++ classes was created to provide functionality of the process.
The developed system allows creating catalogues of standard stars spectral
distributions, databases of different objects spectral observations and
photometric light curves.  The application utilises the client/server model 
with Windows Socket functionality based on TCP/IP protocol and provides DDE 
facilities in server mode.  This software is used also for acquisition and 
analysing spectral observations of asteroids.
