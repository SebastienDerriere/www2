Financial support request by Dr Ninan Sajeeth Philip
----------------------------------------------------

This is a letter of recommendation in support of Dr Sajeeth Philip's
request for financial support to attend ADASS 2003.  I met with Sajeeth
at one of the SCMA - Statistical Challenges in Modern Astronomy -
conferences in Penn State University, and was impressed by his
wide-ranging activities which include use of neural networks and
statistical methods for data analysis.  Sajeeth's work includes
applications in astronomy.  Other areas in which he works include machine
learning and cryptography.  Since our initial meeting we have kept in
close contact, and have discussed various issues related to astronomical
light curve classification, image analysis, and other related areas.

It is clear that Sajeeth is a very deserving case for support, given that
the distance is large, and the exchange rate of Indian currency is not
strong.  It is clear also that our Indian colleagues - including Sajeeth
- are playing an important role in virtual observatory and related
advanced algorithm research and development work.  I hope it will be
possible to help him in participating in ADASS 2003.

Best regards,
Fionn Murtagh
