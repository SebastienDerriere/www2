 The Information Bulletin on Variable Stars is a bulletin fully available in
electronic form. We are working on converting the text, tables and figures
of the papers published to a database. IBVS Data Service will serve
information on variable stars, like finding charts, comparison stars,
light curves etc., and will be VO compatible.
