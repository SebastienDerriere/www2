Hello,

Igor Chilingarian asked me to recommend him for participating to ADASS.
Igor is an outstandingly bright your student. Though he is only starting
the PhD he has a wide astronomical culture and he is also an experimented
observer.

He knows absolutely everything regarding computers: He can tell you what
is the current best choice for a flat screen, teach you unix commands that 
you never heard of, write you a data analysis program in idl or c, and much 
more. He is familiar with votable...

His work on the postgres back end merit to be presented, and he is
fluent enough in English to make a nice talk.

Salutations. Philippe Prugniel.
