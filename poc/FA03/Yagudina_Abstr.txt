     The modern sets of observations demand special programming system
with built in it database.
The special problem-oriented programming system ERA (Ephemeris Research
in Astronomy) with included into ERA database has been developed in IAA
RAS under Krasinsky [1].
The system is designed to support scientific research in astronomy and
space science (ephemeris prediction,simulation of observation programs,
comparison of positional observations with dynamic theories and so on)
as well as for the aims of the astronomical educations. With ERA it
is possible to work out new applications using a dedicated high level
language SLON which manages an applied program package for dynamic and
ephemeris astronomy.
ERA supports ephemerides of the Sun, the Moon, major planets and their
satellites, lunar and planet landers, minor planets, Earth's artificial
satellites, spacecrafts.
If the ephemeris degrades with time and needs updating, this work may
be carried out with ERA as a tool from an analysis of appropriate
observations.
To facilitate the work of this kind useful astrometric catalogues and
other data are included into the ERA database.
The example of processing radar and photographic mimor planet observations
using ERA system and data kept in the form of tables is illustrated.
