Title: Determination of initial conditions of M81 triplet using Evolution
Strategies

Abstract:

In this work we present Evolution Strategies (ES) as an efficient method
to approximate the initial conditions of the main interacting group of
three galaxies in M81.

The M81 group is one of the nearest groups of galaxies. Its biggest
galaxy, M81, sits in the core of the group together with its two nearby
companions M82 and NGC3077. The interaction between these three galaxies
is very well defined on an image taken in HI. In this first attempt we use
non-self-gravitating simulations to approximate the initial conditions;
even with that restriction our method reproduces the density distribution
of the three galaxies with great precision.

Results presented here show that ES is an ideally suited method to work in
optimization problems in Astrophysics, where the solution is hard to find
by common methods. In particular we argue that ES is a good method to find
initial conditions of groups of interacting galaxies, where a large number
of parameters need to be determined.
