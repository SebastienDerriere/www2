The operation of the Radio Astronomical Database CATS with Linux cluster.

Vladimir Chernenkov, Sergei Trushkin, Oleg Verkhodanov, SAO RAS, Russia


The ``CATalogs supporting System'' (CATS; http://cats.sao.ru)
is in operation since  1996 and is developed in the Special Astrophysical
Observatory RAS. CATS includes common accessible collection of the all largest
radio astronomical catalogues, many X-ray, optical, and infrared
catalogues of the extragalactic  sources. In the database there are special
search programs (select/match) allowed to search for cosmic objects in
selected sky area with a batch command by e-mail query or HTML-forms and
CGI-routines.

A powerful processor (CPU) needs for the CATS database architecture,
operating with the 330 large catalogs, containing from 200 to 2000000 rows of
calculating data and carrying out massive celestial coordinates computing for
a search or a cross-identification of cosmic objects.

OpenMosix cluster over Linux PCs resolves such task actually.
The operation with e-mail queries is relevant for multi-computing of many
processes. Then the Apache demon ``httpd'' loading needs the ``Migshm''
patching of the openmosix-kernel for effective child's processes migration,
used a common shared memory.
We tested the heterogeneous cluster (PC AMD-K7 1 GHz, and PC Intel-P4 1.8 GHz),
operating under the Linux Red Hat 8.0, (plus openMosix 2.4.20-2 and Migshm-1.3
DSM) connected by Fast Ethernet (100 Mbit) communication.
