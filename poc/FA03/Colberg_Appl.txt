Dear Sir or Madam,

   I want to apply for financial aid for the ADASS 2003 conference.
I am intending to give a talk about "Webservices for the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey", possibly even doing a demo. The talk will
introduce a first webservice built for the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey, which allows people to define a set of data to extract
from the SDSS database and then to run a very efficient user-
defined N-point correlation function code on it. That way, the
user can benefit from remote computing power and network
traffic itself is kept to a minimum. The N-point correlation is
a standard analysis done on astronomical datasets and it is
only the first of a series of services which will be implemented
for the SDSS.
   Find appended a CV with a list of publications. My personal
information:
