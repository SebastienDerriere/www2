Dear ADASS XIII Committee Member,

I am pleased to write a reference letter for Ms. Trilce Estrada, who is 
applying for financial aid to attend the Astronomical Data Analysis Software 
and Systems Conference in Strasbourg, France, next October. I have known Ms. 
Estrada for a year, first she was a student in two graduate courses I taught 
and recently she has started working on her M.S. thesis in computer science 
under my supervision. She has had an excellent performance in her courses, 
obtaining the best grades in her class, as well as in her research work, 
where she has shown outstanding ability to carry out interdisciplinary 
research. For her thesis, Trilce is working on novel machine learning 
techniques for solving difficult problems in astronomy. The work she plans 
to present at ADASS shows a clever solution to the problem of determining 
the age of starbursts in AGN from high resolution spectra.

As funds are scarce in our country, it would be very difficult for Ms. 
Estrada to attend the conference without financial aid from the organizing 
committee.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you need further information.

Sincerely yours,

Dr. Olac Fuentes
