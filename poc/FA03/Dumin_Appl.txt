Dear Organizing Committee of the Conference
Astronomical Data Analysis Software & Systems XIII,

I would like to apply for a financial aid to attend your
Conference. (Since I am permanently living and working in Russia,
my own funds are very limited.) Please, find below my application.

If my contribution to the Conference will be accepted, I ask you
to send me as soon as possible the official invitation, so that
I will have sufficient time for applying for a travel support
(tickets) to the local Russian sources. Please, send me such
invitation both by ordinary mail (to the postal address given
below) and by fax (+7-095-938-2229).

Sincerely yours,
Dr. Yurii V. Dumin
(IZMIRAN, Russ. Acad. Scis.)
