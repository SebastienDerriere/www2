Hi Dick,

We'll soon create a new acronym: YARL = Yet Another Recommandation Letter.

Here is one, from Ray Plante for Paulo Cortes.

Marc.

Dear Program Organizing Committee,

I am happy to recommend to you Paulo Cortes for financial aid to
attend ADASS 2003. Paulo is a breed of graduate student that we, as a
community, are in great need of. While pursuing a PhD in
millimeter-wave astronomy here at the University of Illinois (under
the direction of Prof. Richard Crutcher), he works with me as a
research assistant at NCSA on parallel computing issues in radio
astronomy. As an RA at NCSA, he has worked with me to profile I/O
performance of AIPS++ applications on Linux clusters. During that
project, I was impressed with his efforts to tap into expertise in the
university's computer science department. His current work, as you
can see from his abstract, is about developing portable parallel
software modules for astronomical processing. Because parallel
processing in astronomy today is still fairly specialized and
underdeveloped, this work focuses on techniques to bring it more into
mainstream use. He also has a great interest in the future of ALMA.
Paulo's competence and excitement for both research astronomy and
astronomical computing makes him a valueable asset and a person worth
investing in for our community.

ADASS can be an important resource in the education of young
astronomer-programmers. It provides them with a snapshot of the
current problems in our field and exposes them to the latest
techniques and technologies. And perhaps because of their lack of
entrenchment in large projects, students like Paulo are more capable
of gathering new ideas from a broad spectrum of activity. I don't
believe, however, that any student could harvest effectively at ADASS.
It first takes a vision of what astronomical computing can do for
scientific research. It also requires an ability to build skills
outside the classroom through one's own work and by engaging with the
work of others. I believe Paulo has these tools to benefit from
ADASS.

Sincerely,
Dr. Raymond Plante
NCSA
