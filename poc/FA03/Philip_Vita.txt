\item{{\bf Vita and Bibliography} (maximum 2 printed pages)

\subitem{{\bf A brief introduction to my research field:} I work on designing
machine learning tools for automated classification and regression problems.
These tools, aka Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) find application in all areas
of research where data mining is required. As a graduate student I  have
developed a fast and efficient neural network model based on Bayesian
principle for probabilistic estimation of likelihoods. This tool has been
successfully deployed in many practical problems such as climate prediction
and stock market prediction. The new tool is called a Difference Boosting
Neural Network (DBNN).

At present, I am collaborating with Shaukat N. Goderya at Illinois State
University, using DBNN for a broader, automated, classification of galaxy
types. The objective of this study is to classify galaxies into five
morphological subclasses. The preliminary results showed remarkable
improvement in classification accuracy from 68\% to 89\% when DBNN was
used instead of other popular neural network tools. We are in the process of
publishing this work. }
