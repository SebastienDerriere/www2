Presentation Title           Information system on binary stars
Presentation Abstract 

We present an Information system on binary stars (ISBS). The main goal
of the system is to collect information on masses and other
astrophysical parameters of components of binary/multiple systems. A
current version of ISBS contains astronomical data catalogues, related
to observations of eclipsing binary stars. The present interface gives
access to the summary description of the catalogues either by GCVS
identifier or by evolutionary type. The ISBS allows user to make
statistical investigations as well as to obtain data on a particular
binary system.
