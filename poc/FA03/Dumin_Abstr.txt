  Presentation Title:

IMACON: A Free Software for Digitizing the Astronomical Images

  Presentation Abstract:

One of the most frequent procedures in astronomical computing is
digitizing the graphic images for their subsequent processing by
numerical methods.  Although such digitizing is a quite trivial
procedure, which is incorporated to all the specialized software
packages, it often becomes a serious problem for the astronomers
and astrophysicists who use only the general-purpose graphics editors
(such as Adobe PhotoShop or Corel PhotoPaint) and the high-level
programming languages (e.g. Fortran).  To provide the "first aid"
in such a situation, we developed a quite simple utility IMACON
(working in MS DOS or Windows environment), which is freely available
via Internet at http://www.user.cityline.ru/~dumin.  As follows
from a considerable number of positive replies obtained during
the last three years, this utility became a valuable tool both for
professional and amateur astronomers in the developing countries,
who do not have access to the expensive specialized software.  It is
interesting to mention that IMACON was used most frequently (about 70%
of replies) for digitizing the solar images and maps of the solar
magnetic fields obtained by the cosmic heliospheric observatories
SOHO and Yohkoh.  The second important area of application (about 20%
of replies) was studying the meteors and artificial plasma clouds
in the near-Earth space.
