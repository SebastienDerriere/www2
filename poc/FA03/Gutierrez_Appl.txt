      o Presentation Abstract:

The ESA's space observatory INTEGRAL (INTErnational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics
Laboratory) was launched on October 17, 2002. The OMC (Optical Monitoring
Camera) is one of the onboard instruments, designed to obtain V-Johnson
photometry from the prime targets of the two INTEGRAL Gamma-ray instruments 
(15 keV-10 MeV) with the support of the X-ray monitor(3-35 keV). OMC offers 
the first opportunity to make long observations in the optical band
simultaneously with those at X-rays and Gamma-rays. This capability will 
provide invaluable diagnostic information on the nature and the physics 
of the sources over a broad wavelength range.

LAEFF has developed a scientific archive, containing the data generated
by the OMC, and an access system capable of performing complex searches. A 
remarkable point is the existence of visualization and analysis tools, 
available from the user's interface, aiming at optimizing the scientific 
return of the OMC data. In this poster, the main functionalities and 
contents of the system are described.
