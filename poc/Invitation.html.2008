<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>"Boiler plate" ADASS Key Speaker Invitation</H2>

<P>Dear [potential speaker], </P>

<P>
[Customized introductory verbiage... ]
The organizers of the Astronomical Data Analysis Software and Systems (ADASS) 
conference have been working on the program for this year.  The Committee is 
very keen to have you speak on your work related to [designated topic], 
and we would be delighted if you would accept our invitation to speak this 
year, with the specific focus of your talk to be left to your discretion.  
One of the key topics in this year's program is [key topic name], and your 
talk would make a great contribution in this area.  </P>

<P>
This year's conference will be held from 2 to 5 November in the
Hotel Loews Le Concorde in Qu&eacute;bec City, Canada, and will be hosted locally by the
National Research Council Canada with assistance from the
Universit&eacute; de Montr&eacute;al and Universit&eacute; Laval.<br>
You can browse the ADASS Web
pages at: http://www.adass.org/ for background information about the 
ADASS conference.  More details about this year's conference will be
available at: http://www.adass.org/adass2008. </P>

<P>
The ADASS attendees are typically about 50% programmers, 20% technical
leads/project managers, and the remainder being scientists ranging from
grad students to senior astronomers.  Roughly 70% list astronomical 
research among their professional activities. We strive to keep the program
strongly rooted in astronomy by including some speakers who describe
the (often quite innovative) analysis they do in the course of their
scientific research.  Your talk should be about 25 min in length to
allow about 5 min for discussion.  The proceedings will be published
on the Web and in the ASP Conference Series; if you agree to speak we 
expect to be able to accommodate your written contribution of up to 10 
pages. </P>

<P>
You should know that the conference registration fee is waived for
invited speakers and we hope that they will attend most, if not all, of
the conference.  We do ask that you submit your abstract in a timely
manner so that it can be included on the final program, as well as on the
Web version of the preliminary program. (See the information regarding
deadlines on the Web page above.) </P>

We would be very pleased to have you speak at ADASS this year. 
[customized verbiage about why speaker is a great "match" with ADASS]. </P>

<P>
Please let me know fairly soon, preferably within the next week, whether
you can accept this invitation so that the program can be finalized. </P>
