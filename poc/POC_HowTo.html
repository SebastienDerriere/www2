<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>POC Member Duties</H2>

Members of the ADASS Program Organizing Committee are expected to participate 
in the following activities:

<OL>
    <LI>Suggest key topics and themes that would be of broad interest 
	for the ADASS audience.</LI>

    <LI>Identify high-caliber individuals who can speak authoritatively 
	on topics of relevance to ADASS, and recruit one or more of 
	them to speak at the conference.  Act as the contact point and 
	"advocate" for those speakers.  </LI>

    <LI>Identify opportunities for "tag-along" events, tutorials, and 
	other supplementary material that would enhance the conference 
	program.</LI>

    <LI>Participate in the detailed planning for each conference.  
	This includes crafting the oral program from the invited and 
	contributed papers, selecting and scheduling the BoFs, and 
	participating in the review of financial aid applicants.</LI> 

    <LI>Solicit funding from the national funding agencies and the POC 
	member's home institution to support the conference and related 
	activities.</LI> 

    <LI>Participate in POC decisions on various matters of policy, 
	including those dealing with publication, financial aid, and 
	general questions of program content.</LI> 

    <LI>Attend formal and informal POC meetings, and nominate new 
	POC members as necessary.</LI> 

    <LI>Help on special POC projects.</LI>

</OL>

<P>
Activities 1-3 take place early in the calendar year: from 
January through March, and it involves from a few hours to a day's 
worth of effort.  Item 4 takes place a few months prior to each conference, 
and involves perhaps 1-3 days of effort per person.  Item 6 takes very 
little effort, and is spread throughout the year (except for some 
concentrated activity at the POC meetings).  The POC meets formally only 
once per year, on the last day of the conference.  We meet informally 
whenever our paths cross, typically at AAS or SPIE meetings.  

<P>
The last point (8) is relatively new, and is best illustrated with 
a couple of examples.  We are developing the adass.org Web site 
to, among other things, serve as a collection point for the ADASS 
"corporate memory," the conference proceedings, announcements, and as 
an engine in the support of ADASS conference administration (with a 
listserver, ftp area, etc.)  There are a number of other services that 
are planned for the site that we believe will serve the ADASS community, 
as well as the broader astronomical community.  In the end, though, we 
will likely have to implement all of the 
selected services with volunteer help from some POC members.  There 
are other special projects as well, such as the informal ADASS 
"Publications Board" which helps to establish sensible editorial policy, 
identify new and promising technologies that can be applied to the 
proceedings work, etc.  POC members participate in all of these "extra-
curricular activities" according to their available time and interest.
