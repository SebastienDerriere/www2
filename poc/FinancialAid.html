<P>
A limited amount of financial aid is available to help pay for attendance

<P>
If you are requesting financial aid, <B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">DO NOT</FONT></B>
fill out a registration form at this time. All requests for financial aid will 
be considered after the abstract deadline.  Those requesting financial aid 
will be notified soon after that date as to the status of their request.  At 
that point the registration forms should be submitted.  If the financial aid 
is granted, instructions will be provided on how to indicate this on the 
registration form.  If aid is not granted, applicants will be given an 
opportunity to register at the early discounted rate.</P>
