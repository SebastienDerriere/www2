<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Local Organizing Committee Planning Details</H1>

<P>
This document is a collection of notes and advice from experience gained 
from putting together prior ADASS conferences. </P>

<H3>Dates and Duration</H3>

<P>Traditionally ADASS has been held in early to late fall, with dates as 
early as mid-September and as late as mid-November.  (See 
<A HREF="http://www.adass.org">www.adass.org</A> for specific dates.)  
Any time in that range would be ok, provided it 
avoids major holidays and conferences that have a large potential overlap 
with the ADASS audience.  Often the hotel or other venue will impose even 
more restrictions on dates.  </P>

<P>
The duration of the conference is set by the POC, but generally the main 
conference takes 3 full days, usually begining on a Monday.  The day prior 
to the conference is often used for special events, such as tutorials, 
tours of local sights, and the opening reception in the evening.  This 
planning has the advantage that attendees can begin their travel on a 
Saturday, which often results in lower airfares.  
On occasion a tag-along meeting will be planned on the day following the 
conference. </P>

<H3>Advertising</H3>

<P>Beyond creating links from the <A HREF="http://wwwadass.org/">adass.org</A> 
Web site, the conference should at a minimum be advertised on the 
<A HREF="http://cadcwww.hia.nrc.ca/meetings/">International Astronomy 
Meetings List</A> at http://cadcwww.hia.nrc.ca/meetings/.  The <I>AAS 
Newsletter</I> draws its entries from here, I believe.  Meeting 
announcements can be sent to the adass.org list server, at 
<TT>adass-announce@adass.org</TT>.  This list contains ~900 names, including 
all who have ever registered for an ADASS conference and the addresses of a 
large number of people who have published a paper recently on astronomical 
data analysis.  E-mail addresses for the conference registrants should be 
updated on adass.org periodically, so that specific meeting announcements 
sent to <TT>adass-conference@adass.org</TT> will reach the intended audience. 
</P>

<H3>Expected Attendance</H3>

<P>Attendance is typically 280 when ADASS is held in the US, and about 220 
when held outside.  Attendance is also strongly affected by the proximity of 
major astronomical centers, such as in Boston or Tucson.  A lot 
of the reason for lower attendance when ADASS was hosted by CADC/DAO (1993) 
and ESO (1997) is that it is often easier for astronomers and engineers 
outside the US to get funding for foriegn travel.  This is obviously not 
the ideal situation, but it is a factor.
</P>

<H3>Budget</H3>

<P>Budgets have run from $65,000 to $105,000, mostly depending upon the 
locale.  Often the Local Organizing Committee (LOC) will select specific 
dates to avoid the most expensive seasons.  At least in the US, 
it is difficult to factor out the cost of the "facility" from the 
cost of, e.g., coffee breaks since the hotel contracts are set largely 
upon the expected number of "room-nights" of occupancy and other factors, 
and the cost of arranging catering and other services is at some level 
artificial.  The budget obligations include the cost of one copy of the 
proceedings for each attendee. </P>

<P>On the other side of the balance sheet, the LOC must plan the budget for 
the current year; the (legal) responsibility for the contracts lies with 
the hosting institution.  The LOC needs to coordinate with the POC to set 
the registration fees such that all the anticipated costs are covered, 
with an appropriate contingency.  In most years the other sponsoring 
organizations (NOAO, NRAO, STScI, SAO, etc.) that are represented on the 
POC will each contribute between $1000 and $5000 US to defray conference 
costs.  In addition, we request support from governmental funding agencies, 
such as NASA and NSF in the US.  Finally, the POC has a fund, which is 
managed by NOAO, that is used to apply excess funds (if any) from one 
conference to the next, or is used to cover unanticipated cost overruns 
for a given year.  Generally there has been little difficulty in funding 
ADASS. </P>

<P>However, there are some difficulties when ADASS is not held in the 
US.  Specifically, it is not allowable for some US federal or quasi-federal 
organizations (NASA, NSF, and SAO in particular) to sponsor conferences that 
are not held on US soil.  To overcome this difficulty, the POC has recently 
begun paying the cost of the proceedings (roughly $14,000 US) directly from 
the "carry-over" fund, since the volume is produced by the ASP Conference 
Series, which is US-based.  Also, it should be possible for European 
organizations to provide an institutional contribution, particularly when 
ADASS is held in Europe.</P>  

<H4>Balance Sheet</H4>

<P>The following items should be included in the budget. All amounts are in 
$US. </P>
