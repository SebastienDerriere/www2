    <h1 class="h1">POC Member Duties</h1>
    <p>Members of the ADASS Program Organizing Committee are expected to participate   in the following activities: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Suggest key topics and themes that would be of broad interest   	for the ADASS audience.</li>
      <li>Identify high-caliber individuals who can speak authoritatively   	on topics of relevance to ADASS, and recruit one or more of   	them to speak at the conference.  Act as the contact point and   	&quot;advocate&quot; for those speakers. </li>
      <li>Identify opportunities for &quot;tag-along&quot; events, tutorials, and   	other supplementary material that would enhance the conference   	program.</li>
      <li>Participate in the detailed planning for each conference.    	This includes crafting the oral program from the invited and   	contributed papers, selecting and scheduling the BoFs, and   	participating in the review of financial aid applicants.</li>
      <li>Solicit funding from the national funding agencies and the POC   	member's home institution to support the conference and related   	activities.</li>
      <li>Participate in POC decisions on various matters of policy,   	including those dealing with publication, financial aid, and   	general questions of program content.</li>
      <li>Attend formal and informal POC meetings, and nominate new   	POC members as necessary.</li>
      <li>Help on special POC projects.</li>
    </ol>
    <p> Activities 1-3 take place early in the calendar year: from   January through March, and it involves from a few hours to a day's   worth of effort.  Item 4 takes place a few months prior to each conference,   and involves perhaps 1-3 days of effort per person.  Item 6 takes very   little effort, and is spread throughout the year (except for some   concentrated activity at the POC meetings).  The POC meets formally only   once per year, on the last day of the conference.  We meet informally   whenever our paths cross, typically at AAS or SPIE meetings. </p>
    <p> The last point (8) is relatively new, and is best illustrated with   a couple of examples.  We are developing the adass.org Web site   to, among other things, serve as a collection point for the ADASS   &quot;corporate memory,&quot; the conference proceedings, announcements, and as   an engine in the support of ADASS conference administration (with a   listserver, ftp area, etc.)  There are a number of other services that   are planned for the site that we believe will serve the ADASS community,   as well as the broader astronomical community.  In the end, though, we   will likely have to implement all of the   selected services with volunteer help from some POC members.  There   are other special projects as well, such as the informal ADASS   &quot;Publications Board&quot; which helps to establish sensible editorial policy,   identify new and promising technologies that can be applied to the   proceedings work, etc.  POC members participate in all of these &quot;extra-  curricular activities&quot; according to their available time and interest. </p>
