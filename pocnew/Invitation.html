    <h2 align="center">&quot;Boiler plate&quot; ADASS Key Speaker Invitation</h2>
    <p>Dear [potential speaker], </p>
    <p> [Customized introductory verbiage... ]  The organizers of the Astronomical Data Analysis Software and Systems (ADASS)   conference have been working on the program for this year.  The Committee is   very keen to have you speak on your work related to [designated topic],   and we would be delighted if you would accept our invitation to speak this   year, with the specific focus of your talk to be left to your discretion.    One of the key topics in this year's program is [key topic name], and your   talk would make a great contribution in this area. </p>
    <p> This year's conference will be held from 4 to 8 October at the  Renaissance Sapporo Hotel in Sapporo, Japan, and will be hosted locally by the  National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ).  You can browse the ADASS Web  pages at: http://www.adass.org/ for background information about the   ADASS conference.  More details about this year's conference will be  available at: http://www.adass2009.jp </p>
    <p> The ADASS attendees are typically about 50% programmers, 20% technical  leads/project managers, and the remainder being scientists ranging from  grad students to senior astronomers.  Roughly 70% list astronomical   research among their professional activities. We strive to keep the program  strongly rooted in astronomy by including some speakers who describe  the (often quite innovative) analysis they do in the course of their  scientific research.  Your talk should be about 25 min in length to  allow about 5 min for discussion.  The proceedings will be published  on the Web and in the ASP Conference Series; if you agree to speak we   expect to be able to accommodate your written contribution of up to 10   pages. </p>
    <p> You should know that the conference registration fee is waived for  invited speakers and we hope that they will attend most, if not all, of  the conference.  We do ask that you submit your abstract in a timely  manner so that it can be included on the final program, as well as on the  Web version of the preliminary program. (See the information regarding  deadlines on the Web page above.) </p>
We would be very pleased to have you speak at ADASS this year.   [customized verbiage about why speaker is a great &quot;match&quot; with ADASS].
<p> Please let me know fairly soon, preferably within the next week, whether  you can accept this invitation so that the program can be finalized. </p>
