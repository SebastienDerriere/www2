    <h1 class="h1">Local Organizing Committee Planning Details</h1>
    <p> This document is a collection of notes and advice from experience gained   from putting together prior ADASS conferences. </p>
    <h3>Dates and Duration</h3>
    <p>Traditionally ADASS has been held in early to late fall, with dates as   early as mid-September and as late as mid-November.  (See <a href="http://www.adass.org">www.adass.org</a> for specific dates.)    Any time in that range would be ok, provided it   avoids major holidays and conferences that have a large potential overlap   with the ADASS audience.  Often the hotel or other venue will impose even   more restrictions on dates. </p>
    <p> The duration of the conference is set by the POC, but generally the main   conference takes 3 full days, usually begining on a Monday.  The day prior   to the conference is often used for special events, such as tutorials,   tours of local sights, and the opening reception in the evening.  This   planning has the advantage that attendees can begin their travel on a   Saturday, which often results in lower airfares.    On occasion a tag-along meeting will be planned on the day following the   conference. </p>
    <h3>Advertising</h3>
    <p>Beyond creating links from the <a href="http://www.adass.org/">adass.org</a> Web site, the conference should at a minimum be advertised on the <a href="http://cadcwww.hia.nrc.ca/meetings/">International Astronomy   Meetings List</a> at http://cadcwww.hia.nrc.ca/meetings/.  The <em>AAS   Newsletter</em> draws its entries from here, I believe.  Meeting   announcements can be sent to the adass.org list server, at   adass-announce@adass.org.  This list contains ~900 names, including   all who have ever registered for an ADASS conference and the addresses of a   large number of people who have published a paper recently on astronomical   data analysis.  E-mail addresses for the conference registrants should be   updated on adass.org periodically, so that specific meeting announcements   sent to adass-conference@adass.org will reach the intended audience. </p>
    <h3>Expected Attendance</h3>
    <p>Attendance is typically 280 when ADASS is held in the US, and about 220   when held outside.  Attendance is also strongly affected by the proximity of   major astronomical centers, such as in Boston or Tucson.  A lot   of the reason for lower attendance when ADASS was hosted by CADC/DAO (1993)   and ESO (1997) is that it is often easier for astronomers and engineers   outside the US to get funding for foriegn travel.  This is obviously not   the ideal situation, but it is a factor. </p>
    <h3>Budget</h3>
    <p>Budgets have run from $65,000 to $105,000, mostly depending upon the   locale.  Often the Local Organizing Committee (LOC) will select specific   dates to avoid the most expensive seasons.  At least in the US,   it is difficult to factor out the cost of the &quot;facility&quot; from the   cost of, e.g., coffee breaks since the hotel contracts are set largely   upon the expected number of &quot;room-nights&quot; of occupancy and other factors,   and the cost of arranging catering and other services is at some level   artificial.  The budget obligations include the cost of one copy of the   proceedings for each attendee. </p>
    <p>On the other side of the balance sheet, the LOC must plan the budget for   the current year; the (legal) responsibility for the contracts lies with   the hosting institution.  The LOC needs to coordinate with the POC to set   the registration fees such that all the anticipated costs are covered,   with an appropriate contingency.  In most years the other sponsoring   organizations (NOAO, NRAO, STScI, SAO, etc.) that are represented on the   POC will each contribute between $1000 and $5000 US to defray conference   costs.  In addition, we request support from governmental funding agencies,   such as NASA and NSF in the US.  Finally, the POC has a fund, which is   managed by NOAO, that is used to apply excess funds (if any) from one   conference to the next, or is used to cover unanticipated cost overruns   for a given year.  Generally there has been little difficulty in funding   ADASS. </p>
    <p>However, there are some difficulties when ADASS is not held in the   US.  Specifically, it is not allowable for some US federal or quasi-federal   organizations (NASA, NSF, and SAO in particular) to sponsor conferences that   are not held on US soil.  To overcome this difficulty, the POC has recently   begun paying the cost of the proceedings (roughly $14,000 US) directly from   the &quot;carry-over&quot; fund, since the volume is produced by the ASP Conference   Series, which is US-based.  Also, it should be possible for European   organizations to provide an institutional contribution, particularly when   ADASS is held in Europe.</p>
    <h4>Balance Sheet</h4>
    <p>The following items should be included in the budget. All amounts are in   $US. </p>
