WWW SYSTEM DIRECTORIES
-----------------------

/u1/www contains web system configuration files (or anything we don't want
mirrored).  Public adass files should be placed in the "adass" subdirectory,
which is a link to the adass subdirectory in the FTP area.  This odd
structure allows the files to be accessible via both HTTP and FTP.

See /u1/README for details.
