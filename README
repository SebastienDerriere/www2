Important 2022 note:
--------------------

Currently the /u1/www/htdocs/ contains the active adass.org 
Do not edit the /u1/www/htdocs files directly, as the
source is currenlty on https://github.com/teuben/www2
and will be rsync'd by Peter


WWW SYSTEM DIRECTORIES
-----------------------

/u1/www contains web system configuration files (or anything we don't want
mirrored).  Public adass files should be placed in the "adass" subdirectory,
which is a link to the adass subdirectory in the FTP area.  This odd
structure allows the files to be accessible via both HTTP and FTP.

See /u1/README for details.

sigh, i've lost all history?


Annual Updates
--------------

Usually after the annual ADASS a few updates should be done as soon as possible:

- move the old ADASS URL to pastven.html
- add any new to futureven.html , possibly move new URL into index.html
- update the index.html with the new URL
- update the POC.html (some rotate off, some new loc comes on)
- update the loc.html. We usually copy, but the list is also on their new URL
- any updated for proceedings.html ?
