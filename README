Important 2022 note:
--------------------

Currently the /u1/www/htdocs/www2 contains the active adass.org pending
permission issues.  Do not edit the /u1/www/htdocs files directly.

The www2 source is currenlty on https://github.com/teuben/www2


WWW SYSTEM DIRECTORIES
-----------------------

/u1/www contains web system configuration files (or anything we don't want
mirrored).  Public adass files should be placed in the "adass" subdirectory,
which is a link to the adass subdirectory in the FTP area.  This odd
structure allows the files to be accessible via both HTTP and FTP.

See /u1/README for details.

sigh, i've lost all history?
