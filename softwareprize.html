    <h1 class="h1"><strong>Software Prize</strong></h1>

    <p>
      The ADASS Prize for an Outstanding Contribution to Astronomical
      Software is awarded every year at the annual conference.
      Eligible candidates are the developers of astronomical software
      ranging from those that have stood the test of time to those
      that are new and cutting edge.  Depending on the software and
      the nomination, the award is given to either a group or an
      individual. Nominations can be for a single program, a package
      or a library. Nominations come from the ADASS community and
      are voted on by the Program Organizing Committee.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>2020:</strong> William Pence for his work on CFITSIO,
      a library of subroutines for reading and writing FITS
      files.  which has been used in countless astronomical software
      packages over two decades.  It provides a de facto reference
      implementation of the FITS standard in addition to supporting
      common extensions used by the astronomical community.  CFITSIO
      has proven to be both robust and portable, providing a stable
      code base for numerous projects across many operating systems
      and development languages.  This award is presented in
      recognition of the outstanding contribution of CFITSIO to the
      astronomical software community and for Bill's efforts in
      leading the project since its inception.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>2021:</strong> Doug Tody, Lindsey Davis and Frank Valdes
      for the design and development of the core IRAF system and
      science packages that have enabled almost 25,000 scientific
      papers since 1986.  IRAF (Image Reduction and Analysis Facility)
      is a software system developed originally by the National
      Optical Astronomy Observatory (now NSF's NOIRLab) that has been
      extended by astronomers and institutions to provide a standard
      platform for data reduction and pipeline processing for numerous
      ground and space-based observatories.  This award is presented
      in recognition of the outstanding contribution of IRAF to the
      astronomical software community and the key role these awardees
      had in developing the core system.
