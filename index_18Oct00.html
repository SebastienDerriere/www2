The <B>Astronomical Data Analysis Software and Systems</B> (<B>ADASS)</B>
Conference is held each year at a different hosting astronomical institution.
<p>
The Conference provides a forum for scientists and programmers concerned
with algorithms, software and software systems employed in the reduction and
analysis of astronomical data.  An important element of the program is to
foster communication between developers and users with a range of expertise
in the production and use of software and systems.  The program consists
of invited talks, contributed papers, and poster sessions.  A number of user
group meetings and special interest group meetings (called BOFs) are also held
during the Conference.
